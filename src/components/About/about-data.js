  `I’m a Senior Frontend Engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, high-impact web applications, specializing in React, TypeScript, and user-facing product experiences that balance performance, accessibility, and polish.`,
  `Most recently at Nike, I worked on the core Product Display Page (PDP) — a high-traffic, revenue-critical surface — where I partnered closely with design, product, and QA to ship performant, accessible UI after a major refactor. The work demanded strong frontend architecture, attention to UX detail, and confidence shipping changes at scale.`,
  `My strongest skills sit at the intersection of frontend
    architecture, state management, and product thinking. I care deeply
    about performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability, and
    I’m comfortable taking ownership of features from early discovery
    through delivery and iteration. I work closely with product
    managers, designers, and backend engineers to ensure the UI isn’t
    just visually polished, but reliable and intuitive under real-world
    conditions.`,
  `Previously, I’ve built and maintained fintech and SaaS applications at Workday, NorthOne, and Azlo, delivering secure, data-driven interfaces for banking, onboarding, and internal planning workflows. Across roles, I’ve focused on translating complex business logic into intuitive, trustworthy user experiences.`,
  `I’m strongest on the frontend but comfortable working across the stack when needed — collaborating on API contracts, integrating services, and thinking end-to-end about product quality. I enjoy owning ambiguous problems, mentoring teammates, and continuously improving frontend systems, patterns, and developer experience.`,
  `I’m currently focused on Senior Frontend Engineer / Product Engineer roles where I can own meaningful UI surfaces, work closely with design and product, and help teams ship high-quality experiences at scale.`,
  `Outside of work, I continue sharpening my skills through hands-on
    projects, technical study, and keeping current with modern React,
    TypeScript, and frontend best practices.`,

In my recent role at Nike, I helped optimize the Product Display
Page—core to the customer product discovery journey. Working as a
senior React developer, I focused on performance, speed, and
efficiency within a Next.js web shell and multiple micro frontends,
directly impacting the shopping experience for millions of users.
<br />
<br />
Before that, at Workday, I helped to re-architect an internal
planning and milestone tracking project, merging Jira data with
internal systems. By leveraging React, RTK, Material UI, and
Node.js, I improved maintainability, streamlined workflows, and
built robust visualizations with Recharts for enterprise-scale
planning.
<br />
<br />
At NorthOne, I assisted with enhancing and optimizing the front-end
React.js and React Native banking applications, adding features like
outgoing wire transfers and mobile check deposits while cleaning up
significant technical debt. Earlier at Azlo, my work rebuilding the
Angular onboarding flow using NgRX and RxJS boosted conversion
rates, reduced customer support workload, and strengthened fraud
protection.
<br />
<br />
Earlier in my career at Intel and McAfee, I built internal tools,
web dashboards, and web automation frameworks that improved product
health visibility and optimized platform operations.
<br />
<br />
Apart from developing, some other activities that I love to do!
